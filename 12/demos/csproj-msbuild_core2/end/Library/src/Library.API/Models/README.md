NOTE:

Different DTOs for different purposes.
For example 
there is a DTO (BookForCreationDto) for receiving stuff sent by the client when they want to add a Book in the database
there is a DTO (BookForUpdateDto)   for receiving stuff sent by the client when they want to update a Book in the database
etc.
